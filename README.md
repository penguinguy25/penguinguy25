# hello yall! üêß
I'm penguin, a programmer that doesn't really know what he's doing<br>
Stuff about me:<br>
- I know a bit of Python
- Working on my C journey right now (it's going pretty bad)
- Made a gravity sim in C (unfortunately this 20 line project is my most notable and important one)
- I'm stupid
- I like the color purple
- I speedcube (decent at it I guess? best official solve was a 21.58s)
